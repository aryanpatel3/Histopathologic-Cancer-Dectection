# Histopathologic-Cancer-Dectection
Built a convolutional neural network that identifies metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans by using Keras. Used a modified version of the PatchCamelyon dataset from Kaggle to train the model by splitting the data into a training set and validation set. Applied image augmentation to artificially create new training data to improve the performance and ability of the model to generalize.
